// Narration + spotlight anchors for the live walkthroughs. Each step's `find`
// is a snippet of text the REAL page renders; the tour highlights the card that
// contains it. Lines are concise and TTS-clean for the British voice. A view
// only gets a live tour when it has BOTH steps here and fixtures in
// tourFixtures.ts — otherwise PageTour falls back to the mock GuidedTour.
