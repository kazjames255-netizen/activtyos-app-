# 11 — Open questions and decisions taken without the owner

Owner asleep, standing order: no questions. Each item below was decided by the lead and is reversible.

1. Curriculum map: owner earlier asked for it as the first thing on Lessons; the brief says simplify. Decision: the one-line summary is first on Lessons; the grid is collapsed by default (remembered per device). One-line revert in CurriculumCard.tsx.
2. Additive server fields: `/notes/counts` gains fields (P-02); erase/export gain collections (P-11). No migrations.
3. Broadcast idle expiry: 6 h -> 90 min, child heartbeats no longer bump `updatedAt` (P-01).
4. Tab merge (P-10) done as renames + alias map only; real merge waits for one Mark queue.
5. Tutor->parent nudge message template NOT built (needs consent/tone design; R-9).
6. Acting-as stamping, ParentGate server enforcement, per-child accommodations: roadmap.
7. Set MAIL_ALLOWLIST before any marking tests (dev mail is live).
